✅ Project Title: Papergrid Homepage UI Clone
Time Period: April 2025

Project URL: paper-grid-home-page-suhaib-nadakkavils-projects.vercel.app

Associated With: Brototype – Brocamp

Description:
This was my seventh overall project and fourth project after joining Brototype’s 7-month offline Brocamp program. I recreated the homepage of the Papergrid website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and media queries to practice e-commerce layout design and mobile responsiveness.
I built the layout by understanding structure through W3Schools and then hand-coded the full UI with custom classes and responsive grid design. The project helped me strengthen real-world web layout skills like product card design, navigation bars, and color branding — all without using any design templates.

Tech Stack:

HTML

CSS

Bootstrap

JavaScript

Media Queries

GitHub for version control

Deployed on Vercel

Key Highlights:

E-commerce style homepage layout with product grid

Fully responsive and mobile-first design

Practice in Bootstrap grid, navigation menus, and brand UI cloning
